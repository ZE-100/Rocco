# Formulas
Here you'll find all the formulas in a somewhat understandable way.

### Definition of certain terms
| Term | Definition | Calculation |
|:----------------:|:--------------|:-------------:|
| throatArea | The throat area is the tightest area in a rocket engine. <br/> It is used to concentrate the flow of matter to an optimal speed of Mach 1 | (D/2)^2 * PI |
| totalPressure |  |  |
| totalTemperature |  |  |
| heatRatio |  |  |
| gasConstant |  |  |
| ***standardPow*** |  |  |
||||
| mDot |  |  |
| A | A is used to describe a certain area of something. <br/> Ae is the area at any point in the exhaust system |  |

### Mass Flow Rate (mDot)
throatArea * (totalPressure / sqrt(totalTemperature)) * sqrt(heatRatio / gasConstant) * ((heatRatio + 1) / 2)^-standardPow

### Exit Mach (Ae / throatArea)
